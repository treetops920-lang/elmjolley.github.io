    <section>
        <p> Hello, I'm Elm Jolley; currently a senior at Kettering Fairmont High School.
            Over the past two years, I've been a part of the career technical center program offered by Fairmont, with
            this opportunity,
            I've been able to gain valuable experience in the IT field, preparing me for my future career. I've spent
            much of my time learning to code, and understand the hardware of computer; which has driven me go to college
            and gain a degree in Computer Engineering.
        </p>
        <p>
            In my Informational Technology program, I've learned a variety of programming languages, including HTML,
            CSS, JavaScript.
            I've also gained experience with hardware components, networking, and cybersecurity.
            Through hands-on projects and real-world scenarios, I've developed problem-solving skills and the ability to
            work collaboratively in a team environment.
            My time in the program has solidified my passion for technology and has given me the confidence to pursue a
            career in this field.
            While also providing me with such an amazing opportunity to intern at The Education Connection.
        </p>
        <p>
            Outside of the technical program, I play in my school's orchestra, and have been for the past 6 years. I
            play the viola, having begun my learning of the instrument in the fourth grade prior to moving to the state
            of ohio.
            I also have held some form of a job since sophomore year; starting my work history in October of 2023,
            opening the Centerville location of Huey Magoos. From there I have had a total of three jobs.
            Leaving me with a growing work experience of over 1000 hours.
            Working, and being part of something bigger than I am has shown me good work ethic, importance of teamwork,
            and handling of high stress, fast pace environments.
        </p>
        <p>
            Growing up, I moved around a lot; having been a military brat for the first 16 years of my life up till my
            father retired.
            Living across the United States and even Germany in my early childhood, bouncing around during elementary
            school, and having the best opportunities
            I've been given so far thanks to the Kettering school district that I am lucky to have been managed to stay
            in.
            Having had moved so much, I've learned to adapt quickly to new environments, and make the best of any
            situation I possibly can.
            Thanks to my experiences, I have learned what I want to do with my life, from college, to career, and even
            hobbies.
            I'm excited to see where life takes me next, and to hopefully take any amazing opportunities that come my
            way.
        </p>
